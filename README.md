### This repository contains proof of my hands-on exploration of Microsoft Azure.
### I have worked directly in the Azure portal and tried out several core cloud services to understand how they function in real scenarios.

### As part of my learning, I created resources in Azure, uploaded data, and practised moving data between services to understand how cloud workflows operate.
### The screenshots included here show the actions I performed inside Azure while experimenting with these services.

### This repository will be updated over time as I continue building more practical cloud activities and structured examples.
